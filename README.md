# MVVM-News-App
### I tried my best to make a news app using new jetpack-compose and realm DB with MVVM clean architecture.The techstack of the app is given bellow:


1. Jetpack Compose : It is a modern toolkit for building declarative and reactive user interfaces for Android apps.

2. Realm : It is an open-source, object-oriented database management system (DBMS) designed primarily for mobile applications (Android and iOS) but also usable for other platforms like Xamarin, React Native, and desktop applications (Windows). 

3. Retrofit : It is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java that simplifies REST API consumption by converting HTTP API into a Java/Kotlin interface.

4. Web view : It is a composable element in Jetpack Compose that allows you to embed a web page within your Android application.

5. ViewModel : It is a class that holds UI-related data and business logic separate from the UI layer.

6. Dagger-Hilt : It is a library that simplifies dependency injection in Android using Jetpack Compose.

7. Dependency injection : It is a technique for providing objects that a class needs (its dependencies) instead of creating them itself.

8. Use case : It in Android Clean Architecture represents an individual task or operation performed by the application, encapsulating business logic and interacting with the domain layer.
